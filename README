Galene-ldap: LDAP integration for the Galene videoconferencing server.

For more information about Galene, please see <https://galene.org>.

1. Build galene-ldap

    CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags='-s -w'

2. Create galene-ldap.json

There are two ways to perform client authentication using LDAP: using the
BIND request or matching passwords on the client side.  Using BIND is
recommended.

In order to use BIND, your galene-ldap.json should look like this:

    {
      "httpAddress": ":8444",
      "ldapServer": "ldap://localhost:389",
      "ldapBase": "ou=users,dc=yunohost,dc=org",
      "key": {"alg":"HS256","k":"xxx","key_ops":["sign","verify"],"kty":"oct"},
      "groups": ["test-auth"],
    }

The field `groups` indicates the set of Galene groups that galene-ldap
will authorise; you will also need to configure these groups on the Galene
side (see below).

The field `key` should be a (private or shared) key in JWK format;
I generate mine using

    jose jwk gen -i '{"kty":"oct","alg":"HS256"}'

In order to use client-side matching, set the field `ldapClientSideValidate`
to true, and define a privileged user with access to the passwords using
the fields `ldapAuthDN` and `ldapAuthPassword`:

    {
      "httpAddress": ":8444",
      "ldapServer": "ldap://localhost:389",
      "ldapBase": "ou=users,dc=yunohost,dc=org",
      "ldapClientSideValidate": true,
      "ldapAuthDN": "cn=admin,dc=yunohost,dc=org",
      "ldapAuthPassword": "xxx",
      "key": {"alg":"HS256","k":"xxx","key_ops":["sign","verify"],"kty":"oct"},
      "groups": ["test-auth"],
    }

3. Provide a TLS server certificate

    cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.org/privkey.pem key.pem
    cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.org/fullchain.pem cert.pem

4. Run galene-ldap

    nohup ./galene-ldap -debug &

5. Configure a group in Galene

Create a file `groups/test-auth.json` with the following contents:

    {
        "authServer": "https://galene-ldap.example.org:8444",
        "authKeys": [
          {"alg":"HS256","k":"xxx","key_ops":["sign","verify"],"kty":"oct"}
        ]
    }

The `authServer` field is the URL at which you instance of `galene-ldap`
is publicly accessible (it is okay to put it behind a reverse proxy).  The
`authKeys` field is a list of keys, and must include the key used by
`galene-ldap` (or at least its public part, if you're using asymmetric
keying).

# Configuration file reference

The `galene-ldap.json` file may contain the following fields:

  - `groups`, the set of groups we will validate; requests for groups
    outside this set will cause the client to fail login or to fallback to
    password authentication, depending on `passwordFallback`;
  - `passwordFallback`, if true, then the client will be instructed to
    fallback to password authentication if the group or user is not found;
    by default, we instruct the client fail logins for unknown users,
    which avoids leaking passwords to the server;
  - `httpAddress`, the address on which the HTTPS server listens,
    in the format `host:port`;
  - `insecure`, if true we run HTTP instead of HTTPS; this is only
    suitable when running behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS;
  - `key`, the key used for signing tokens, in JWK format;
  - `ldapServer`, the URL of the LDAP server (`ldap://` or `ldaps://`);
  - `ldapBase`, the base DN used for user searches;
  - `ldapAuthDN` and `ldapAuthPassword`, the DN and password we will bind
    as before performing a search; it not specified, we perform an
    anonymous BIND;
  - `ldapClientSideValidate`, if true, then we validate passwords in the
    client; by default, we validate passwords by attempting a BIND.
